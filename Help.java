        "Initially the field is set up to be 300 by 300. This dictates the size of the " + 
        "geographical coordinates that can be used. The graph space uses the same coordinate limits " +
        "To alter the field space choose Other > Options. Note that while the application changes " + 
        "size, old Agents still have coordinate systems that use the old field sizes - coordinates " + 
        "aren't recalculated until new Agents are generated.\n\n" +
        
        "You can either generate a set number of Agents with a random geographical distribution " + 
        "and an initial circular graph of connections (each Agent is connected to the next and the " +
        "last to the first) using the Layout > Ring World option, or you can import Agents written in " + 
        "XML (see 'Importing', below). Making a new Ring World will wipe any imported Agents and vice versa. " +
        "By default 10 Agents are created, though this can be altered in Other > Options. " +
        "As well as their coordinates in the two spaces, the Agents each have a name, a double value, " +
        "and a set of Attributes. If randomly generated these are set to 'Agent-X' (where X is " + 
        "the number of the Agent in the order they were created), zero, and nothing, respectively.\n\n" +
        
        "Viewing:\n\n" +
        "The Agents are displayed initially in geographical space. To view them in graph space, select " +
        "View > Graph Space. The color can be altered under Other > Options in three ways. The default " +
        "is to colour them on the basis of two sets of scrollbars, which control the red, green and blue " +
        "levels of the Agents and the lines of connection. However, they can also be coloured with a " + 
        "rather funky random option, or by the level of the Agent's 'value'. For details of altering the " +
        "value, see 'Running' below. The connections go both ways between connected Agents, however, they " +
        "will be coloured on the basis of only one of the Agents where appropriate.\n\n" +
        "Clicking on a given Agent with your mouse will bring up a dialog displaying the Agent's " + 
        "name, value, and attributes.\n\n" +

        "Connections:\n\n" + 
        "By default random Agents are given connections to the Agents generated just before and after " +
        "themselves, with the last linked to the first. Imported Agents can decide on their own connections. " + 
        "The connections can be subjected to the Small World algorithm of Duncan J. Watt's 1999 paper " + 
	"'Networks, Dynamics, and Small World Phenomenon', AJS, 105(2), 493-527. " +  
	"Similar algorithms can be found in his book 'Small Worlds'. " +

        "Running:\n\n" + 
        "The Agents can be run as-is. The default is to run each Agent through 10 iterations. " + 
        "The number of iterations can be changed under Other > Options. The order in which " + 
        "Agents are picked is random within an iteration, though each is picked once each iteration. " + 
        "The number of iterations can be altered under Other > Options. The default behaviour is simply " +
        "to set the Agent's 'value' to the number of neighbours/connections it has in graph space. " + 
        "To generate more complex behaviour, programmers should subclass the Agent class and override " + 
        "their 'update' method, which is called each iteration. The Agent variables are 'protected' so " +
        "they can be used directly by subclasses. By updating each Agent's 'value' property, " + 
        "programmers can easily display changes in the Agent's Attributes'.\n\n" +
        
        "Importing/Exporting:\n\n" +
        "The system will read in XML descriptions of Agents (Layout > Import). The XML used is " + 
        "broadly based on the FIPA Abstract Architecture Specification for Agents " + 
        "(http://www.fipa.org/specs/fipa00001/SC00001L.html#_Toc26668620) " + 
        "though it currently misses the agent-locator property.\n\n" + 
        "The XML for each Agent should be on its own line. The XML tags are:\n" +
        "<AGENT-NAME></AGENT-NAME>\n" +
        "<AGENT-ATTRIBUTE></AGENT-ATTRIBUTE>\n" +
        "The AGENT-NAME must be present. AGENT-ATTRIBUTE tags can contain any name-value pair, " +
        "for example,\n\n " + 
        "<AGENT-ATTRIBUTE>x=200</AGENT-ATTRIBUTE>\n\n" + 
        "x, y, z, graphX, graphY, graphZ, " + 
        "neighbours and value are recognised (case sensitive) and parsed into the relevant Agent variables, " + 
        "all others are stored as KeyObject-Object pairs in the Agent's attributes Hashtable.\n\n" +
        
        "Neighbours/connections should be given in the form " + 
        "<AGENT-ATTRIBUTE>neighbours=one&two&three</AGENT-ATTRIBUTE>. When geographical or graph " + 
        "space coordinates are missing they are generated randomly, or on a circular graph respectively.\n\n" +
